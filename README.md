Semester2 Final Assignment.

End of semester assignment, built with jQuery Mobile. No styling as focus was on demonstration of JSON
and social media APIs implementation. Profile section allows access to details via Facebook Graph API
(may not work without a refreshed user token), Pictures via the Flickr API, and a number of instances in
which ajax calls where made through JSON to fetch server data. JSON syntax and string interpolation was
then used to organise the data in list views and create links to other pages or functions.

Home section demonstrates a simple instance of the HTML <video> tag and the Twitter feed API.

Location section shows use of HTML's geolocate function, implemented with the GoogleMaps API to continuously 
track the user. It also provides a number of addresses that can be accessed and located on the map through
the "Find DIT" button.

Initial build lacks code optimisation, will update in the future to use more loops and switch statements.
